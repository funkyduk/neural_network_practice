# Neural Networks Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Neural Networks Learning Projects** repository! This is where Iâ€™ll be organizing and storing code from various tutorials and projects as I learn and explore the fundamentals of neural networks.

## About

This repository serves as a personal learning space for experimenting with neural networks. The projects and scripts here are primarily sourced from tutorials and educational content, providing hands-on practice and reinforcement of key concepts.

## Current Projects

### P1.py  
This script is part of the tutorial series by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex) on YouTube:  
[Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI).  
It's a great introduction to building neural networks step by step, focusing on understanding the core mechanics.

## How to Use

Not much to it for now. Just download the code and run it. Make sure numpy is installed: `pipx install numpy`
